# Particle Filter
In order to solve the localization problem of a robot through particle filters and MCL, we first had to design and implement a suitable motion model and sensor models as well as a resampling procedure. The majority of the design decisions were highly motivated by "Sebastian Thrun, Wolfram Burgard, and Dieter Fox. Probabilistic robotics. MIT press, 2005"
